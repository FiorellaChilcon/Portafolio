          I'm a front-end developer from PerÃº, and my journey in tech began with a bootcamp that ignited my passion for programming. Over the past 4 years, I've dedicated myself to creating dynamic and visually appealing user interfaces that showcase my creativity and problem-solving skills. Currently, I'm making my way from the vibrant culture of Peru to the bustling tech scene in Australia, pursuing a Bachelor's degree in IT and Cybersecurity to deepen my knowledge and expertise.
